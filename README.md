# Rule Validation API

The Rule Validation API is a simple RESTful API using Nodejs to validate if a field value satisfies a given condition.
See API validation description and documentation [here](https://flwat.glitch.me/fulltime.html)

## Using the API

You can access the live API on Heroku using https://fast-garden-88705.herokuapp.com/ as the base URI.

### Local Machine

Clone the repository [here](https://github.com/Vikhthor/RuleValidatorAPI).

To run the API on the local host, you need to have Nodejs and npm installed installed and running.

In the cloned repository directory, run the commands:

1. Install dependencies

> $ npm install

2. Start the application

> $ npm start

The API endpoints will then be exposed on:

> http://localhost:3000
